Random Walk Notebook

The objective of this project is to replicate Richard S. Sutton's article on Learning to Predict by Methods of Temporal Differences and implement Random Walk using temporal differences instead of supervised learning.

For further details and analysis, please review Random_walk.pdf.

Steps to run the uploaded Jupyter Notebook, random_walk.ipynb, are shown below. This will create and run the random walk algorithm using temporal differences and corresponding plots:
