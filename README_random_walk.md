Random Walk Notebook

The objective of this project is to replicate Richard S. Sutton's article on Learning to Predict by Methods of Temporal Differences and implement Random Walk using temporal differences instead of supervised learning.

For further details and analysis, please review Random_walk.pdf.

Steps to run the uploaded Jupyter Notebook, random_walk.ipynb, are shown below. This will create and run the random walk algorithm using temporal differences and corresponding plots:

1) Run cell 1 to import all the necessary libraries and create the class to perform the Random Walk algorithm
2) Run cell 2 to run experiment 1 which tests updating the weights every 10 sequences
3) Run cell 3 to create a plot to show the error for each lambda value using a constant alpha
4) Run cell 4 to run experiment 2 which updates the weights after each sequence
5) Run cell 5 to create a plot to show the error for each alpha value for each lambda
6) Run cell 6 to create a plot to show the error for each lambda value using best alpha
