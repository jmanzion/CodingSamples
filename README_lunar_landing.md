Lunar Landing Notebook

The objective of this project is to solve the lunar landing game from OpenAI Gym using Deep Q-Learning.

For additional details and analysis of lunar_landing.ipynb, please refer to lunar_landing.pdf.

Steps to run the uploaded Jupyter Notebook, lunar_landing.ipynb, are shown below. This will create and run the Deep Q-learning algorithm to solve tghe Lunar Landing game from OpenAI Gym.

1. Run cell 1 to import all the necessary libraries
2. Run cell 2 to setup the neural network
3. Run cell 3 to setup the class and functions to train the model
4. Run cell 4 to train the model
5. Run cell 5 to create a graph to see the rewards per episode during training
6. Run cell 6 to save the model (if necessary)
7. Run cell 7 to load the model (if necessary)
8. Run cell 8 to create a graph using the trained model to see reward per episode
