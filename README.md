# Coding Samples

Included are 4 separate coding projects:
1) kmeans.py - Python file to run k means clustering using Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance to perform color compression on selected images.
2) lunar_landing.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to use Deep Q-Learning to solve the Lunar Landing problem in OpenAI Gym.
  *pdf included with further analysis (lunar_landing.pdf)
3) random_walk.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to replicate Robert Sutton's work creating the Random Walk algorithm using temporal differences.
4) PCA.py -  Python file to utilize Principal Component Analysis to find the primary features of two subjects from the YaleFace dataset and use that to be able to detect the subject in other images.
