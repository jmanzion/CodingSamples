# Coding Samples

Included are 3 separate coding projects:
1) kmeans.py - Python file to run k means clustering using Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance to perform color compression on selected images.
2) lunar_landing.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to use Deep Q-Learning to solve the Lunar Landing problem in OpenAI Gym.
3) random_walk.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook to replicate Robert Sutton's work creating the Random Walk algorithm using temporal differences.
